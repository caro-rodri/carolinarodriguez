Diversified cropping systems have been highlighted as a way to enhance sustainability since the combination of crop diversification practices through spatial and temporal scales may support ecosystem functioning. **This research project explored the effects of crop and cropping system diversification in the functions and compositions of agroecosystems in the Scania region in Sweden.**
