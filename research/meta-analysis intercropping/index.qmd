After my Ph.D. studies, I did a short-term Postdoc in the [Farming Systems Ecology group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/farming-systems-ecology-group.htm) at Wageningen University. The project was focusing on identifying agroecological crop traits for designing diversified cropping systems. Through a systematic review (Meta-analysis) explore the effects of diversified vegetable production worldwide, focusing on several ecosystem services to provide farmers with practical knowledge of the benefits of crop diversification to a larger extent.
