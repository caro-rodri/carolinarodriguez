During this summer school, we open spaces to discuss how nature and human relations have been expressed in academic and policy arenas. The group included several students and researchers from different backgrounds and universities worldwide. We then got the opportunity to apply to the AHIA, Alternet High Impact Actions award, where we got funded to develop this idea further to illustrate human and non-human nature connectedness using the nitrogen cycle as a case study.\nThe project participated in the Alternet Conference 2022 ‚ÄúTransformative Changes for Biodiversity and Health‚Äù in Ghent, Belgium. Both with a session proposal, ‚ÄúTransforming our perceptions of Human-Nature relationships for transformative change‚Äù, and with an oral presentation in the same session, ‚ÄúCan the Lorax and the Once-ler ever be friends?"

I focused on crop diversification practices and the implications for resource use and cropping systems sustainability. I had the opportunity to visit the INRA UNR agonomie in Thiverval-Grignon as a PhD student for one month in 2017.
