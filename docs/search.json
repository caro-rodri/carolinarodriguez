    "text": "As a researcher, I include theories and methodologies in natural and social sciences that I apply in my current research. I focus on producing knowledge relevant to the transformation of both urban and rural farming systems. My research aims to support (urban) farmers through research, training interventions and co-design locally relevant production systems to build more sustainable management practices and develop more multifunctional urban and rural landscapes.\nAfter my PhD studies, I had a short-term position as a Postdoc in the Farming Systems Ecology group at Wageningen University, performing a meta-analysis on diversified (intercropping) vegetable production systems.\nI finished my doctoral studies at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. I focused on crop diversification practices and the implications for resource use and cropping systems sustainability. I had the opportunity to visit the INRA UNR agonomie in Thiverval-Grignon as a PhD student for one month in 2017. I have also been a member of the European association for Agroecology since 2018.\nA short CV can be downloaded here"
